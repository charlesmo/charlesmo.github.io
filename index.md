# Brief Bio

I am currently a master studect major in Computer Science at University of St. Andrews graduating in 2024. Previously, I obtained my first Master's degree from the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at University of Pennsylvania, where I developed controller for off-the-shlef quadroter based on real-time estimation (with Dr. Sikang Liu). I got my bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiaotong University major in Mechaotrincs.

From 2017 to 2022, I started a tech company called Proton Robotics LTD in Shanghai.

We were raised 4 million USD in total from top-tier global VC funds, lauched the product onto the market and obtained commercial contracts valued over 2 million USD from companies including Nike, Alibaba and Nestle.
